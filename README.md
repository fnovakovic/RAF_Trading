Android Application - Final project

A mobile application that deals with tracking and trading shares on the market. 
The application provides users with the ability to follow market news and information, view popular stocks, manage their portfolio and buy/sell stocks.

Here are some features of the app:

Splash/Login Screen: On the splash screen, the application checks whether the user is already logged in. If so, it redirects him to the main screen, otherwise it takes him to the login screen. Validation of the user's entries is also performed here, including checking the correctness of the email format, the minimum length of the password and matching the preset password.

Main Screen (Discover, Portfolio, Profile): The main screen consists of three parts - Discover, Portfolio and Profile. The Discover screen provides information about news and popular actions, which are obtained directly from the server. The portfolio screen allows users to track their investments, portfolio history and portfolio value chart. The profile screen contains information about the user and allows logging out of the application.

Detailed Stock View: This screen provides detailed information about the selected stock, including current value, value history, and basic information such as OPEN, BID, CLOSE, etc.

Buy/Sell: Users are allowed to buy and sell shares. On the buy screen, users can choose whether they want to buy in pairs or in number of shares. On the sell screen, they can choose to sell all or a certain number of shares.
